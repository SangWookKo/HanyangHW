* SEEDING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *This year, regions will be seeded based on previous results from the past 2 years of MSI and Worlds.

* With the addition of Vietnam, MSI is now a 14 region event. The play-in stage will continue to include

  region from the previous 2 years are KR, CN, EU and NA. Although LMS had the stronger showing at MSI
  2017, they were outperformed by NA at Worlds 2107, Worlds 2016 and MSI 2016.
